**Global Income Score** aims to solve the question "Will I survive in X?".  Through researching cost of living data in every metropolitan area in the United States and finding the PPP (personal price parity) of every country across the world, a user, given a household income, can determine whether or not you can survive in a given location.

Here are some of its features:
  
âœ… **Search Bar** â€” Easily look up countries, states, or metropolitan areas to see income and cost of living comparisons.

âœ… **Comparison Chart** â€” Visualize how your inputted income stacks up against the local cost of living through interactive charts.

âœ… **Google Maps Integration** â€” Explore regions with an intuitive map interface powered by the Google Maps API for better geographic context.
